# GCD of Two Numbers

## Problem Statement

Write a function `gcd` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given integers.

## Definition

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` is the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `12, 18`  
**Output:** `6`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `101, 103`  
**Output:** `1`

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`
- The input consists of two integers.
