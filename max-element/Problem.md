# Max Element

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find and return the maximum element in the array.

## Definition

The maximum element in an array is the largest integer present in the given list.

## Examples

### Example 1:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Output: 5 Explanation: The largest element in the array is 5.

### Example 2:
Input: arr = [10, 25, 3, 99, 47] Output: 99 Explanation: The largest element in the array is 99.

### Example 3:
Input: arr = [-5, -2, -8, -1, -9] Output: -1 Explanation: The largest element in the array is -1

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 100,000  
- -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9  
- The array contains at least one element.

## Notes

- The function should handle both positive and negative numbers.
- The function should be optimized for large inputs.
- Edge cases, such as an array with a single element, should be considered.
